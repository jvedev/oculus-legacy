main and session are the content of two iframes
in these directory you find all generated bundels

there is a lot of code shared between main and session 

please refactore the code

- split these big files into smaller ones and make this code modular
- all duplicate code that is used in main and session should be moved to a shared directory
- don't change any funcions or implementations all code should stay as is
- add vite to the project as a bundler  
in the end I want to be able to generate two bundles main and session
